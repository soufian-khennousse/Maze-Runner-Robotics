This repository contains a Maze Runner project where a robot autonomously navigates through a labyrinth to find the fastest path to the exit. The challenge is structured into three difficulty levels:

1️⃣ Known Map & Exit Location – The robot has full knowledge of the maze structure and the exit position, allowing it to compute an optimal path before moving.

2️⃣ Unknown Map, Known Exit – The robot knows only the exit position but must explore and map the maze while finding the quickest route.

3️⃣ Fully Unknown Environment – The robot has no prior information about the maze or the exit and must explore, learn, and navigate efficiently in real time.

🚀 The goal across all levels is to develop intelligent navigation strategies that optimize pathfinding efficiency, adapting to different levels of uncertainty.

Key Features
✔ Autonomous pathfinding algorithm
✔ Real-time maze exploration & mapping
✔ Adaptive decision-making for unknown environments

🔧 Tech Stack: Python, ROS, Sensor Integration (Lidar/Camera), Pathfinding Algorithms

Feel free to explore, contribute, and improve the navigation strategies! 🎯
